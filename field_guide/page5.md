Occasionally, you might come across flipbooks where an image appears to be missing or partially missing. This is what is known as a partial coadd in the [unWISE](+tab+http://unwise.me/) data. This can happen when the WISE satellite didn't fully capture an area of the sky on a particular pass. Do your best to categorize the rest of the frames as normal, but otherwise classify it as a nonmover.
