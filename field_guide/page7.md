**How Do I Use SIMBAD?** [SIMBAD](+tab+http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/) (the Set of Identifications, Measurements, and Bibliography for Astronomical Data) is a handy database of astronomical objects used by professional astronomers and a crucial tool for us at Backyard Worlds: Cool Neighbors. [This blog post](+tab+https://blog.backyardworlds.org/2017/03/01/getting-started-with-simbad/) explains in detail how to use it to check whether an object you have found is already known or possibly a new discovery. 

We've included a direct SIMBAD link to the object you are viewing on Zooniverse in the subject metadata. You can access it by clicking the (i) button on the bottom right of the flipbook, and then clicking the SIMBAD link. 

If SIMBAD only finds one source on the image you're looking at, it will take you directly to a page of information about that source. Otherwise, SIMBAD will show you a list of astronomical objects listed in order of their distance from the center of the field of view. Click on the links to learn more about the objects that SIMBAD finds! If there are no sources in SIMBAD, you may have found a brand-new object! When discussing subjects in TALK pages, consider using the #insimbad or #notinsimbad tags, respectively.

SIMBAD uses a long list of [abbreviations ](+tab+http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-display?data=otypes) in its tables. For example, PM* = high proper motion Star, BD* = brown dwarf, BD? = brown dwarf candidate, WD* = white dwarf.  You can learn more about SIMBAD from this [Users Guide.](+tab+http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/guide/index.htx)

One of the most useful features of SIMBAD is that for each object in the catalog, it pulls up a list of papers that have been written mentioning that object. Scroll down and 3/4 down the page you should see "References".  You can click "sort references" and see the titles of papers where your favorite object has been mentioned or discussed, if there are any. Be sure to browse through these; your favorite object may already be the focus of a huge international debate--or it may just have played a bit part as a calibrator or an astrometric reference.


**How Do I Use VizieR?**  If you can't find what you are looking for in SIMBAD, you can use [VizieR](+tab+http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR) to query a longer list of astronomical catalogs--almost every catalog that has been published!  You'll find a [much more thorough introduction to VizieR in this blog post.](+tab+https://blog.backyardworlds.org/2017/02/18/an-introduction-to-vizier/)  But here are a few basic tips.

Like with SIMBAD, you can find a VizeR link to the object you are viewing in Zooniverse in the metadata tab of each subject.

Unlike SIMBAD, VizieR gives you LOTS of source lists, one for each of the many catalogs it searches. Each list is in order of distance from location you searched (either the coordinates you estimated, or the center of the field of view).  Each catalog it searches has its own special focus and caveats, so you may have to do some reading to get the most from this powerful tool. Try combing the query results for references to "proper motion" since you are most likely to have identified a moving source.  E.g. you can search the page for the letters "pm" and look for objects with proper motion higher than 100 mas/yr or so. You'll often see "pmRA" for proper motion in Right Ascenscion and pmDE for proper motion in declination. If you find something that's not in VizieR, please flag it on TALK with the #notinvizier hashtag.

**How do I use WiseView?**
WiseView is an online tool built to view flipbooks of WISE data similar to the subjects you are viewing on Zooniverse. However, unlike the Zooniverse flipbooks, in WiseView you have the ability to change a number of different settings that are fixed in Zooniverse. These include the minbright and maxbright parameters (which set the contrast of the image), the sliding window (which controls how adjacent frames are blended into each other to reduce noise), and the Gaia overlay. Gaia is a database of known objects in the night sky.

We've included a link to the WiseView site for each subject in the metadata tab. When you click this link, the Gaia overlay is on by default. If you find a mover in a Zooniverse flipbook, consider checking WiseView to see if a green dot appears over it. If this happens, it means that the object is already known in the Gaia database. If there's no green dot, you may have found a new object! Consider filling out a [Move-In](+tab+https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQ7JKk7HLvmcyK7Qg8qH1tN_IL5F7wl-Kik121OeH_PkRQ1g/viewform?usp=sf_link) form. 


**Note: if you do find your object on VizieR but not in SIMBAD, please submit it to [Move-In](+tab+https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQ7JKk7HLvmcyK7Qg8qH1tN_IL5F7wl-Kik121OeH_PkRQ1g/viewform?usp=sf_link) anyway.**

**Note: do not trust the proper motions listed in the AllWISE catalog on VizieR.** They are often unrealistically high, due to a large amount of measurement noise.
