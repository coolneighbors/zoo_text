If you've ever worn glasses at night and looked at a bright object like a streetlamp, you'll know what a diffraction spike looks like. This type of artifact is caused by interactions between the WISE telescope's support structure of the secondary mirror and bright sources of light. These spikes can be seen emerging out in four primary directions from a particular source and stretch outward from the source.

Although these diffraction spikes may appear to change over time, they are **not** movers! If you see this type of artifact in a frame and don't see a mover in the frame, you can classify the frame as nonmoving.
