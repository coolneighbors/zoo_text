Have you ever stared at a bright object for too long, looked away, and seen an outline of that object everywhere you look? Latent artifacts are essentially the same phenomenon, but happening to the WISE telescope's camera rather than your eye. 

When WISE images an exceptionally bright star some of the pixels can become oversaturated. When it takes a picture of a different part of the sky next, you can sometimes still see a flickering image of the previous star in the frame. 

These latent artifacts may appear like smudged, indistinct stars that appear to fade over time. Mark these as nonmovers if you see one, unless there is also evidence of a mover.
