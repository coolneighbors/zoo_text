[Brown dwarfs](+tab+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf) are balls of gas that never became stars. They have masses between those of stars and planets, making them peculiar objects to study. These intriguing celestial objects are so dim that we need your help to spot them! Join our quest to reveal the Sun's elusive cosmic neighbors using [infrared](+tab+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared) images taken by NASA's [Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer](+tab+https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/WISE/main/index.html) (WISE) telescope. Your discoveries may even get [observed by the James Webb Space Telescope](+tab+https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/citizenscience/members-of-the-public-won-time-on-the-james-webb-space-telescope)!

Backyard Worlds: Cool Neighbors expands on the [Backyard Worlds: Planet 9](+tab+https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backyard_Worlds) project with a targeted search for brown dwarfs.

The work of Cool Neighbors personnel has been supported by NOIRLab, which is managed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.
